# Combined American Signal Set 2

An unofficial successor to the "Combined Americal Signal Set" by Pikka et al, with the goal to be updated to use NML, and support JGRPP's multi-aspect signals.

## Goals

- [ ] Reimplement CASS in NML
- [ ] Implement multi-aspect signals into CASS2

## Test Cases

- Keep vanilla features
  - Block, Pre, Path signals
- Realistic braking ON
  - BLock, Path signals
  - Multi-aspect
